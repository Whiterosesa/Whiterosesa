# WhiteRoseSA

> "In every fortress, there is a crack. In every line of code, a flaw. You just have to look close enough."

Welcome to the digital sanctum of **WhiteRoseSA** — a ghost in the code, a shadow with purpose. I don’t leave exploits behind; I erase them. Before someone with less mercy finds them.


## 🧠 Who am I?

I go by **WhiteRoseSA** — a name born from the belief that even something as beautiful as a white rose can still draw blood. I specialize in cleaning up vulnerabilities, fixing security holes, and refactoring sloppy code. I don’t care who wrote it — if it’s broken, it's getting patched.

This isn't a dev profile. This is a warning.


## 🛠 What I Do

* Fix your code before someone like me exploits it
* Sanitize input, patch XSS, implement DDoS prevention, and harden your system
* Separate spaghetti into clean HTML, CSS, and JS — like it's supposed to be
* Leave behind sarcastic, petty, but brutally honest comments in your code if deserved


## 🕶 Motto

> "it's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission"


## 🔍 Focus Areas

* Code sanitation & security hardening
* Refactoring bloated, single-file codebases
* Patch-first, talk-later philosophy
* Minimalist, efficient, and secured web apps


## 📁 Projects

This profile will consist of forks and contributions aimed at:

* Securing front-end projects
* Removing common vulnerabilities
* Offering smarter structure and better readability


## 📜 Philosophy

You can hide your flaws. But I will find them.
Not every dev knows how to secure their work.
That’s where I come in. Not as your savior.
But as your final audit before someone worse gets there.

Welcome to the other side of the mirror.



## ☠️ Warning

None. Ghosts don’t leave footprints.
